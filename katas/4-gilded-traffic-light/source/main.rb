# An unsightly blob of procedural code that represents a working traffic light system.
#  - Only one direction can be green or amber at a time.
#  - Pedestrians can walk in a direction only when itâ€™s red.
# traffic_light_system.rb
# Deliberately messy, procedural-style code that:
# 1) Updates traffic lights by a single second each time #run is called.
# 2) Uses inline logic for everything rather than neatly separated methods.
